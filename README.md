# React + Vite

Using Tailwind and React, I recreate an Elementor template I had made a while ago. I wanted to improve my React development so I thought this would be a fun one. It's still a work-in-progress, however.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
